# **Task 1: Software configuration.**

## ***Subtask 1: “Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?”.***

Hello! My name is Lidia, I am from Ukraine. Now I live in Poland. Now my country is going through terrible times and its people are forced to flee from war all over the world. But I am sure that our strength and indomitable spirit will overcome all evil. Everything will be UKRAINE! :blue_heart: :yellow_heart:

In order to change the world, you need to start with yourself, so for me, participating in the portfolio challenge project is not just a change, but a new page in my present. I am sure that after the challenge, my hard work will be fully rewarded: new job, new opportunities, new ME!!! :muscle:
